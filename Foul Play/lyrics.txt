I’d only just met you but I’d rather die
Than have to forget you, I can't fathom why
My heart aches when you’re not around
I just want you to take me, I don’t want to drown

Cause you’re crossing my mind, like, every single day
My friends, they advise me to just walk away
I know that loving you would be a foul play
But I just can't have it any other way

My heart stops
Look at me as I drop
No turning back, no going off
I’m going right to the top
Glance my way, and I fall
Bang my head ‘gainst the wall
Look at you, you’re so beautiful
Look at me I'm so small

I’m laying so lonely, trapped behind these walls
Beg for you only but don’t return my calls
I know that I made just one mistake
But if you’re not mine then I might just break

My heart stops
Look at me as I drop
Why can't you see what you’ve done to me
You sent me over the top
Glance my way, and I fall
Bang my head ‘gainst the wall
This ain’t no true or false
Or if so I recall

I see you in the blur
Can't get you out my head
It seems like forever is 3 months instead
You’re soooo fine
I wish that you were mine
We could leave this all behind
Divine...
